# Branch Protection Setup Guide

This guide shows how to configure branch protection rules to enforce the CI/CD workflow.

## Why Branch Protection Matters

Branch protection **enforces** your workflow:
- ‚ùå **Without it**: Rules are suggestions, anyone can bypass
- ‚úÖ **With it**: Rules are mandatory, GitHub blocks violations

## Branch Protection by Environment

### üõ°Ô∏è Main Branch (Production)

**Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule ‚Üí Branch name pattern: `main`**

‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
- Require approvals: `2` (for production changes)
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require review from CODEOWNERS: ‚úì (optional)

‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Status checks required:
  - `lint-and-format`
  - `sdlc-standards`
  - `security-scan`
  - `unit-tests`
  - `build-validation`
  - `pre-release-validation`
  - `final-tests`

‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

‚úÖ **Include administrators** (even admins must follow rules)

‚úÖ **Restrict who can push to matching branches**
- Add specific users/teams who can merge to production

‚úÖ **Rules applied to everyone including administrators**

### üîß Development Branch

**Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule ‚Üí Branch name pattern: `development`**

‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
- Require approvals: `1`
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Status checks required:
  - `lint-and-format`
  - `sdlc-standards`
  - `security-scan`
  - `unit-tests`
  - `build-validation`

‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

‚úÖ **Include administrators**

### üß™ UAT Branch

**Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule ‚Üí Branch name pattern: `uat`**

‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
- Require approvals: `1` (QA team member)

‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Status checks required:
  - `qa-validation`
  - `integration-tests`
  - `performance-tests`
  - `security-validation`

‚úÖ **Include administrators**

## How Protection Enforces the Workflow

### Scenario 1: Developer Tries Direct Push ‚ùå

```bash
git checkout development
echo "bypass" >> src/calculator.py
git commit -am "Quick fix"
git push origin development

# GitHub Response:
# remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed
# remote: error: Changes must be made through a pull request.
```

### Scenario 2: PR with Failing Tests ‚ùå

```yaml
PR Check Results:
‚úÖ lint-and-format
‚úÖ sdlc-standards  
‚ùå unit-tests        # FAILED
‚úÖ security-scan
‚úÖ build-validation

GitHub Status: "This branch cannot be merged"
Merge button: DISABLED
```

### Scenario 3: PR Without Review ‚ùå

```yaml
All checks: ‚úÖ PASSED
Reviews: 0 of 1 required

GitHub Status: "Review required"
Merge button: DISABLED
```

### Scenario 4: Everything Correct ‚úÖ

```yaml
All checks: ‚úÖ PASSED
Reviews: 1 of 1 approved ‚úì

GitHub Status: "Ready to merge"
Merge button: ENABLED (green)
```

---

## Setting Up Status Checks

After your first workflow run, the status checks become available:

1. **Run workflows first**: Push code to trigger workflows
2. **Wait for completion**: Let workflows finish once
3. **Return to branch protection**: Settings ‚Üí Branches
4. **Search for checks**: Start typing in the search box
5. **Select all required checks**: They appear after first run

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "I can't find my status checks"

**Solution**: The checks only appear after they've run at least once. Create a test PR to trigger them.

### "Merge button is disabled but everything is green"

**Check**:
1. Is branch up to date? (Pull latest changes)
2. Are conversations resolved?
3. Do you have required approvals?

### "I need to merge urgently"

**Emergency bypass** (with admin rights):
1. Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
2. Temporarily disable protection
3. Merge
4. **IMMEDIATELY re-enable protection**
5. Document why in merge commit

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start Strict**: It's easier to relax rules than tighten them
2. **Communicate Changes**: Tell team before changing rules
3. **Document Exceptions**: If you bypass, document why
4. **Regular Reviews**: Review rules quarterly
5. **Different by Environment**:
   - Development: Balance speed and safety
   - UAT: Focus on quality
   - Production: Maximum protection

---

## Testing Branch Protection

After setup, test each branch:

### Test Development Protection
```bash
# This should fail
git checkout development
touch test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "test"
git push  # Should be rejected

# This should work
git checkout -b feature/test
git push -u origin feature/test
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Test Main Protection
- Try to merge a PR without reviews (should fail)
- Try to merge with failing checks (should fail)
- Get approval and pass checks (should work)

## Impact on Workflow

With protection enabled:

| Action | Without Protection | With Protection |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Push to main | ‚ö†Ô∏è Allowed | ‚ùå Blocked |
| Merge PR without tests | ‚ö†Ô∏è Allowed | ‚ùå Blocked |
| Merge PR without review | ‚ö†Ô∏è Allowed | ‚ùå Blocked |
| Skip CI/CD | ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible | ‚ùå Impossible |
| Accountability | üòê Low | üíØ High |

---

## Summary

Branch protection transforms your CI/CD from:
- **"Please follow the process"** ‚Üí **"You must follow the process"**
- **Optional quality gates** ‚Üí **Mandatory quality gates**
- **Trust-based** ‚Üí **Enforcement-based**

This ensures consistent quality and prevents accidental or intentional bypassing of your carefully designed workflow!
